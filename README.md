            Team meeting set for next lab 10th May 1-3pm
            Hardware team may meet between then. Alex and James to organise amongst themselves. 

     
After Thursday Week 1 - 4th - 9th May:

    Robot chassis to be built, sensors and camera attached (and working). Start on software design.
 
    Everyone: Make sure that the github repository is working. Sign Team agreement & finish AVC plan (due 7th May).
     - James & Alex: Finalise hardware design. Have the chassis complete – 3D parts printed (marble and sensor mounts). Base and platforms measured, cut and holes drilled. Wheel mounts and camera mount completed. Complete building of bot prototype.
     - Thomas, Adam & Kirsty: Start on methods and code design.
     - Thomas & Adam: Test camera and sensors are working
     - Kirsty: Organise next team meeting. Update progress and documentation in github, check in on members progress
     
     Progress:
    - Hardware - main components completed, just a few tweaks to be done with the camera and sensors by end of week 2. 

Software - basic code dev (moving forward, left and right). 
Various codes committed to github.


     
Thursday Week 2 - 10th – 16th May

    Quadrant 1 & 2 completed
 
    Everyone: Testing and debugging the line following code works. Testing and debugging the codes for quadrant 1 & 2. Start on the progress report.
     - Alex & James: Finish any unfinished parts. Test against coding completed, to make sure hardware fits the code. Make any adjustments as needed.
     - Adam: Develop code for basic movement (moving in a straight line, turning, reversing).
     - Thomas: Implement sensor averaging and image processing code (quadrant 2).
     - Kirsty: Develop networking code (quadrant 1). Organise next meeting. Update progress and documentation in github. Check in on members progress.
